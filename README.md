Bootstrap 5 Internship Project – Reflection Report

1. Step-by-Step Process

Here’s how I completed the project:

Project Setup:

Created a project folder with index.html, about.html, contact.html, and style.css.
Linked Bootstrap 5 via CDN in all HTML files.
Tested each file in a browser locally to ensure basic structure worked.
Exploring Bootstrap Components
Went through Bootstrap 5 Examples to identify useful components.
Collected components like navbar, hero section, carousel, cards, buttons, and forms.
Experimented with them in small test HTML files to understand how they worked.

Page Design & Composition:

Home Page: Added a responsive navbar, a hero section with a call-to-action button, a feature section with three cards, and a footer.
About Page: Designed a section for company/services info with cards and descriptive text.
Contact Page: Added a fully functional contact form with inputs for name, email, and message, along with a submit button.

Styling & Responsiveness:
Used Bootstrap utility classes for spacing, colors, and typography.
Added custom CSS for hero backgrounds, card image sizes, and footer styling.
Tested responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile. Adjusted grids and columns where necessary.

Version Control:

Initialized Git and committed changes to keep track of progress.
Pushed the project to GitHub to maintain a backup and enable deployment.

Deployment:

Deployed the website using GitHub Pages, making it accessible via a live URL.
Verified all pages, images, and links worked correctly online.

2.Tools and Resources Used:

Bootstrap 5 Documentation & Examples – for layout and components.
VS Code – for writing HTML, CSS, and editing code.
Git & GitHub – version control and hosting.
Chrome/Firefox – for testing responsiveness.

3. Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Navbar not collapsing properly on mobile	Used navbar-expand-lg and tested toggler functionality.
Cards misaligned on tablet/mobile	Used row and col-md-4 classes for responsive layout.

4. Learning Journey

Learned how to remix Bootstrap components rather than copying entire examples.
Gained experience in responsive design and grid layout composition.
Understood best practices for deploying a website via GitHub Pages.
Improved skills in UI/UX design, visual hierarchy, and spacing consistency.
Learned the importance of documenting the process transparently.

5. Time Taken

Total time: 30 mins


6. Transparency

Components were remixed from Bootstrap Examples with customization.
All final code is originally combined and customized, not copy-pasted as full pages.
